# Network

Network is group of 2+ devices communicating with each other

Networks are for transfer of information, between organisation or members of the same organisation
+ high capacity
+ fast speeds
+ low latency
+ high availability

## Internet

Internet = global network of nodes, any two nodes can communicate as long as they know the address

Router -> Network

## Outside of internet

Internal networks (printers, servers etc) can communicate without internet
devices on internal networks rely on either router, switch or hub

hub - Low intelligence, any packet received is redistributed to all other nodes
switch - med intelligence, learns which node is on which connection, distributes correctly
router - high intelligence, works as a switch but also allows connection to the wider internet
